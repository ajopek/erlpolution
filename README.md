# ErlPolution

We all know how great Erlang is, but can it help us with todays most urgent issues ?
This project will try to both teach you some erlang, hopefuly for greater good and touch big enviromental issues, like pollution.

At first it will provide functionality for fictional pollution measurement system.

Also will evolve from  basic erlang, then into using OTP, and then ... who knows ...
Evolution takes time and does not always result in the best possible outcome, so give it time and do not hessitate to inform me of any possible improvements you see.

Also assignemnt for university erlang classes.

TO THE FUTURE READER: 
If this project died, just didn't evolve beyond simple university assignment,
I am truly sorry, but thats evolution, some die in the process.
